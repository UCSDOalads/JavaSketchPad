# JavaSketchPad README
This project started with a simple idea of a sketch pad with connected and annotated dots; yet it ends up connecting a handful of UCSD undergrads to create something much more. This side project of ours has helped us learn an enormous amount about coding in Java and team management as well as git usage.
Our project goal is to create a visual exploration of Java API. JavaSketchPad will
```
    1. allow beginners to learn all programming languages visually
    2. enable developers to program faster through visual coding in all programming languages
    3. make visualization of all of Java API possible, bypassing the old way of looking through
       the functionalities in online tedious documentations
```
Currently JavaSketchPad support partially success usage in Java. Most of the development happens in develop branch, and we will push into Master branch every once in a while for the published version.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See “How to work on this project?” for further development details. 

### Prerequisites

```
Java Runtime Environment, J2SE 1.8
Ant Build Tool
```

### Installing

git clone the project through “github.com/UCSDOalads/JavaSketchPad” or through the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/UCSDOalads/JavaSketchPad.git
cd JavaSketchPad
ant run
```


## User Interface Introduction
![alt text](https://github.com/UCSDOalads/JavaSketchPad/blob/demoImage/demo%201.png)
### Menu bar:
Contains all the functionalities that you can use on JavaSketchPad, mainly including Data (Input/Output Box, Annotations, etc), Lazy (Java class, method, etc), Edit (Zoom, font, etc), File (e.g. c.xml), Script (same as the “:” commands to quickly add objects). Among them, Generate, Developer, and View are deprecated or under-development.

### Canvas:
You can interact with the program on the canvas.

### Action History Dialog:
Action History: This table shows the actions user performed in order and each individual action could be highlighted for undo.
Undo button: undo the last action. You can also select a row to highlight that action, so that undoing again will undo until that row (inclusive).
Redo button: Similiar to Undo button.

### Six Button tools: click on the button and click on canvas where you want to put the object (except for Line tool). 
Simple Point: a basic developer point that can be connected with Lines
Select: the default mode that can select other components on canvas
Line: select the Line tool, then connect one point to another. If you want to connect points to pass on data, you have to select the point that contains data and then select the point that the data is going to. This sequence does not matter for Simple Point.
Class (C): create a Java class constructor that can be used to create its methods. To create a method, only select one class, and then click on menu bar (Lazy -> Add -> Java Method). The dot on the left side of a method is input/argument, while the dot on the right side is output/return value.
InputBox (I): A data input box that can be updated with double click or a click on menu bar (Data -> InputBox -> Update). It can also be connected to the left dots of method to pass in argument for methods.
OutputBox (O): A data output box that can be updated with a click on menu bar (Data -> OutputBox -> Update), but only after it is connected to the right dots of method and all the left dots are connected with data.

### MUST READ THIS!
For any class other than java.lang.String class, please use a Constructor that takes in a ***String*** type data to initialize the value to be the corresponding type before constructing lines.
